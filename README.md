# pandas-challenge
Using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school district data and determine if there is a correlation between their budget, student size, and school performance in reading and math.
Completion of the pandas-challenge went well. There was not much outside help needed besides the slides from the class and some assistance from classmates and the professor. One concern is that the analysis portion of the challenge was already included in the starter code supplied by the class. Naturally, changes would be made but the analysis provided hit all major points of the challenge and changing out the analytical points used for anything else would prove a poor replacement.
A question for the grader: on my code everything works but sometimes there is a red "future warning" box. Again, the code allows me to continue on with the exercise and no deleterious effects are seen but if you know what may cause them please let me know. I believe it's probably something to do with conflicting dtypes and functions.
